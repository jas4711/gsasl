/*
  The problem with calling callbacks in the start() function is that
  the callback will have no per-session context at that point, only a
  global context, so the only way to give per-session unique callback
  responses is to use a separate global handle per session.  This was
  discovered in the Exim implementation of gsasl with SCRAM that used
  to request the GSASL_CB_TLS_UNIQUE property in the start() function.
  After noticing this design issue, and writing this self test, it was
  discovered that it also happened for the GSSAPI/GS2 server (not
  client) mechanism for the GSASL_SERVICE and GSASL_HOSTNAME
  properties.
